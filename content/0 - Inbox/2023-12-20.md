* Registered a domain name and spun up a gatsby blog to post short bits about behavioural and UX design along with software development
	* Almost too quick and easy
	* I often post bits about these to people on Discord during conversations, maybe it'd be fun to have these collected and written down somewhere already so I can just point them
* Will consider writing about
	* Designing for Behavior Change by Stephen Wendel
	* Engaged by Amy Bucher
	* Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg
	* Atomic Habits by James Clear
